# Course Notes

Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies (a Princeton course on Coursera)

- Scrooge Coin: An implementation of a simple cryptocurrency ledger that allows checking the validity of transactions and thereby processes valid transactions. In particular, it handles the double-spending problem
