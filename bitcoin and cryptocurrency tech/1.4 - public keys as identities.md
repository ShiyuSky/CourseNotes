## Lecture 1.4 Public Keys as Identities



<u>Useful trick: public key == an identity</u>

if you see $sig$ s.t. $verify(pk, msg, sig) == true$, think of it as:

<center><i>pk says, "[msg]"</i></center>

to "speak for" $pk$, you must know matching secret key $sk$.

<u>How to make a new identity:</u>

- create a new, random key-pair $(sk, pk)$
  - $pk$ is the public "name" you can use (better to use Hash(pk))
  - $sk$ lets you "speak for" the identity

- you control the identity, because only you know $sk$

- if $pk$ "looks random", nobody needs to know who you are

<u>Decentralized identity management</u>

- anybody can make a new identity at any time, as many as they want!
- no central place of registration
- in bitcoin, identities are called "addresses"

<u>Privacy</u>

- addresses not directly connected to real-world identity
- but observer can link together an address's activity over time, make inferences
