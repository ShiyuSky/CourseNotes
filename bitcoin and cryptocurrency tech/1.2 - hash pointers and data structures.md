## Lecture 1.2 - Hash Pointers and Data Structures



Hash pointer:

- pointer to where some info is stored, and
- (cryptographic) hash of the info

If we have a hash pointer, we can

- ask to get the info back, and
- verify that it hasn't changed

Key idea: build data structures with hash pointers

<center>Binary Tree with Hash Pointers = "Merkle Tree"</center>

<u>Advantages of Merkle Tree</u>

- Tree holds many items but just need to remember the root hash
- Can verify membership in $O(logn)$ time/space

<u>Variant: sorted Merkle tree</u>

- can verify non-membership in $O(logn)$ (show items before, after the missing one)

<u>More generally...</u>

Can use hash pointers in any pointer-based data structure that has no cycles (e.g. directed acyclic tree)
