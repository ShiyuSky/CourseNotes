## Lecture 1.1 - Cryptographic Hash Functions



Three properties: Collision-free, hiding, puzzle-friendly

Hash is useful because the output is small.



<u>Hiding property:</u>

If r is  chosen from a probability distribution that has high min-entropy, then given H(r | x), it is infeasible to find x.

<u>Application: Commitment API</u>

$(com, key) := commit(msg)$

$match := verify(com, key, msg)$

To seal $msg$ in envelope:

- $(com, key) := commit(msg) $
- then publish $com$

To open envelope:

- publish $key, msg$
- anyone can use $verify()$ to check validity

Security properties:

- Hiding: Given $com$, infeasible to find $msg$
- Binding: Infeasible to find $msg\ !=\ msg'$ s.t. $verify(commit(msg), msg') == true$

$commit(msg) := (H(key | msg), key)$

$verify(com, key, msg) := (H(key | msg) == com)$

<u>Puzzle-friendly:</u>

For every possible output value y, if k is chosen from a distribution with high min-entropy, then it is infeasible to find x s.t. $H(k | x) = y$.
